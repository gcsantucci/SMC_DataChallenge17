	In this study we have defined how to detect a phase transition in a material given intensity data. The process consists of detecting all the peaks in the data for two adjacent temperatures and calculating defining quantities for every peak, namely, their areas, centers and widths.
	For sets with different number of peaks in the data and with different average width (difference $> 0.005$) we declare that a phase transition has occurred.

	The code used to generate the plots in this study can be found in gcsantucci github repository under SMC DataChallenge Diffraction \cite{git}.
