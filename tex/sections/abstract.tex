	In this study \cite{git} we look for phase transitions as a function of temperature by inspecting data from neutron diffraction. A phase transition is defined here as a structural change in the analyzed  material. We characterize the intensity peak structure in the diffraction data at adjacent temperatures to conclude if a phase transition has occurred.
